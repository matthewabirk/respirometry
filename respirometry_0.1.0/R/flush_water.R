#' @title Find percent of water exchanged after a flush
#' 
#' @description Calculate the proportion of water in a respirometer that is new after a flush. Useful for intermittent respirometry.
#' 
#' @param vol volume of the respirometer (liter).
#' @param flow_rate rate of water flow into the respirometer (liters / minute).
#' @param duration duration of the flush (minutes).
#' @param perc_fresh percent of the respirometer volume that is new flushed water.
#' @param plot logical. Plot the percent exchanged as a function of flow rate and duration to see what effect would result if these rate or duration are changed.

#' # What proportion of a 90 L respirometer is exchanged after 20 minutes of flow at 2 LPM?
#' flush_water(vol = 90, flow_rate = 2, duration = 20)
#' 
#' # Would it be worth it to extend the flush another five minutes? How much would that
#' # improve the exchange?
#' flush_water(vol = 90, flow_rate = 2, duration = 20, plot = TRUE)
#' # Another five minutes would increase exchange by nearly 10%.
#' # Perhaps that's worth the extra time...
