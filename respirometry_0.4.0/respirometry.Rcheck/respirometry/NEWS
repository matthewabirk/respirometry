-------------------------------------------------
version 0.4.0, 2017-05-27
- calc_MO2():			parameter added: "pH" which allows pH data to be summarized along with oxygen and duration data for each bin
- calc_MO2():			parameter added: "time" to include time mean and range in output
- Q10():			added new functionality allowing a vector of rate and temperature values to be input to return the best fitting Q10 value
- calc_MO2():     		columns MEAN_DURATION, MEAN_O2, and MEAN_PH were renamed to DUR_MEAN, O2_MEAN, and PH_MEAN, respectively
- calc_MO2():     		the DUR_RANGE column in the returned data frame is no longer rounded
- calc_MO2():     		"bad" data identified by the parameter "good_data" now split their bin so that linear regressions are not fit through data that contain bad observations in the middle
- conv_o2():			added support for "volumes_percent"
- conv_nh4():			conv_NH4() was renamed and includes support for "mg_NH3" and "umol_NH3"
- predict_nh3():	predict_NH4() was renamed and now returns a list of NH3, NH4, and TAN
-------------------------------------------------
version 0.3.1, 2016-12-31
- calc_MO2():			parameter added: "good_data" which allows identified O2 observations to be excluded from analyses

- mean_pH():			returns an NA rather than error when pH = NULL
- co2_*.R():			improved documentation
- flush_water():		improved documentation
-------------------------------------------------
version 0.1.2, 2016-09-02
