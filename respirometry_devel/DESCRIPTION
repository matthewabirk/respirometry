Title: Tools for Conducting Respirometry Experiments
Version: 1.0.0
Date: xxxx-xx-xx
Author: Matthew A. Birk

Description: Provides tools to enable the researcher to more precisely conduct
respirometry experiments. Strong emphasis is on aquatic respirometry. Tools
focus on helping the researcher setup and conduct experiments. Analysis of the
resulting data is not a focus since analyses are often specific to a particular
setup, and thus are better created by the researcher individually. This package
provides tools for intermittent, flow-through, and closed respirometry
techniques.
