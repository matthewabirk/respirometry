-------------------------------------------------
version 2.0.0, 2024-07-18
- calc_pcrit() and plot_pcrit():	updated so that the classical "breakpoint" method of analysis is used by default. If other methods, or all methods are desired, they should be specified with the "method" parameter.
- calc_pcrit() and plot_pcrit():	for convenience, the output of calc_MO2() can now be inputted directly into these Pcrit functions with the mo2_data parameter, instead of adding po2 and mo2 parameters separately.
- closed():		clarified the usefulness of this function in documentation. Useful for estimating Pcrit trial length. Not ideal for analyzing collected data.
- calc_MO2():		corrected the "binning" behavior to not reuse data in multiple bins when a dataframe was provided for bin_width.
- make_bins():		(hopefully) clarified documentation and how to use make_bins(). Reversed order of rows from previous versions.
- conv_o2():	added support for nmol_per_ml
- For your convenience, added aliases so that calc_mo2() will work as calc_MO2() (for when you forget to capitalize the MO2 part. Same for Q10(), max_MO2(), and scale_MO2(). calc_q10() is now an alias for Q10().
- conv_o2():	No longer breaks when sal=NULL, but instead converts sal to 35psu (the default) and sends out a warning.
-------------------------------------------------
version 1.5.0, 2024-02-09

- calc_b():				can now handle 0 values in either the mass or MO2 parameters when using the "lm" mode.
- calc_MO2():			added a TEMP_MEAN column to the output data frame so that temperature within bins is also included. Thanks to Britney Firth for the suggestion.

-------------------------------------------------
