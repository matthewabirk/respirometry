\title{Mean pH by [H+]}
\usage{
mean_pH(pH, na.rm = FALSE, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{pH}{a numeric vector of pH values.}

\item{na.rm}{a logical value indicating whether NA values should be stripped before the computation proceeds.}

\item{...}{further arguments passed to or from other methods.}
}
\description{
Calculates mean pH from a vector of pH values by averaging [H+] rather than numerical pH values.
}
\details{
Since pH is on a logarithmic scale, averaging pH values directly does not provide the true arithmetic mean of what is likely truly important to the organism, [H+] (however, see Boutilier and Shelton 1980). Thus, the pH values are converted to [H+] then averaged and converted back to a mean pH value.

\examples{
mean_pH(c(7, 8)) # 7.26 rather than 7.5!
