Tools for Conducting Respirometry Experiments

This package provides tools to enable the researcher to more precisely conduct respirometry experiments. Strong emphasis is on aquatic respirometry. Tools focus on helping the researcher setup and conduct experiments. Functions for analysis of resulting respirometry data are also provided. This package provides tools for intermittent, flow-through, and closed respirometry techniques.
